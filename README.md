## Deprecated notice

**This library is deprecated since 2018-02-21**

Please, notice that this package is deprecated and no longer under maintenance.
The last version was 2.5.2. Feel free to fork this project if you found it useful,
but I would recommend you to check https://github.com/phpcfdi for fresh replacements
with better quality software.

As of 2018-02-21 the project https://github.com/eclipxe13/CfdiUtils is a good replacement
that does a lot more than this package. Anyhow, that package will be moved soon to  
https://github.com/phpcfdi organization.

Also, you can chat on https://gitter.im/eclipxe13/php-cfdi with me and other people.
I will be glad to help you to migrate to a newer package.
